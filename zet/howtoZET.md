# How to make a zettel entry

This is the body of the zettel (which means "slip"). 

* First bullet  
* Second bullet

But, when I have ordered or numbered list:

1. First
1. Second
1. Third

```go

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello World!")
  }
  
 ```

What if I want *italic* or **bold** or ***bolditalic***?

How about something that looks like `code`?

And when I have a URL I want it to print: 

https://google.com

* I put references at the bottom
