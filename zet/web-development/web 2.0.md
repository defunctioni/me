# Web 2.0 

* A collection of advances in the early 2000s created a cluster of web applications often called Web 2.0: 

    1) Provide a dynamic user experience by offering content that responds to user input without forcing the page to reload. 
    In Web 2.0, websites could just update selected regions regions of the page.

    2) Emphasize user-generated content and sharing. ie social media, bloging, wikis

* Enabled by important technical advances in the user interface of the internet: 

    1) jQuery was the first JS framework that could fetch data while the web page is running.
    2) The rise of other web frameworks that connected to databases, like Spring, Django, and Ruby-on-Rails enabled user-generated content to effectively be created, stored, and displayed.
