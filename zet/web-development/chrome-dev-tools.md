# Dev Tools Chrome

Chrome dev tools are used to prototype a website. You can see how a website would look if changes were made. Dev tools don't save or overwite
what is in the source code so it is a risk free way of applying changes. 

Chrome dev tools are also useful for debugging. More on this later...
