## Javascript Functions and Events

* Functions allow us to write a chunk of code once that can be used again and again.
* Events allow Javascript to respond to user behaviors, like the user hovering their mouse over an HTML element or resizing their window. 
* Functions and Events together give JS the abiliity to create interactive experiences. When an Event is fired, a function is executed. 
  This pattern is used over and over in web dev to create interactive websites.
