# What is the difference between the terminal, the CLI, and shell?

* Terminal
The terminal is what gives you the cell-based text screen
80 columns * 25 rows is the standard terminal size

* CLI
You can do a CLI without a terminal. CLI AKA REPL(Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop). 
Anything that takes input on a single line, evaluates it and prints back to you.

* Shell
An interactive program that provides access to another system(deeper system). 
Without the shell, we would have to write system calls in C to get anything done.
Anything that connects the user to an inner layer of the computer(kernel).
