Say you have a 2d array called `array1` with 1 row and 2 columns.

* To select only the odd rows starting from the 1st row, aka index 0: 

```python
onlyOddRows = array1[::2]
```

This breaks down to array1[start(:)stop(:)step(2)

* To select only the even rows starting from the 2nd row, aka index 1:

```python
onlyEvenRows = array1[1::2]
```

Need to come back to this to explain what is going on.
