# df.update(whatever-was-changed)

Wow what a day... For some reason Pandas was not updating my changes on a dataframe I changed.
However, David was struggling with the same issue and shared that there are freak instances
when changes are not applied to your dataframe. This includes when you reassign and even when setting inplace=True.
Thanks to him I was able to move forward and learn about the .update method as another way to update dataframes.
